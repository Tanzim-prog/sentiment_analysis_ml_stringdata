# Sentiment Analysis on Text Data using Machine Learning

## The motive of this project is to find out the customer satisfaction of some residential hotels of Dhaka. This project was done in VS Code with Python programming language. The dataset was created through web scraping using parsing method in RStudio using R programming language. Almost 5,000 reviews were collected of 8 hotels in Dhaka City. In this project almost 600 reviews were used of only 1 hotel.

The methods followed in this project are:
1. Data Processing
2. Vectorization
3. Spliting Dataset
4. Evaluate the model
5. Generate Sentiment Score
6. Visualize Sentiment Analysis
